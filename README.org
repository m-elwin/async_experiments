#+TITLE: ROS 2 Asynchronous Service Client
#+AUTHOR: Matthew Elwin

* Overview
Provides examples for calling ROS 2 services asynchronously from python.
For now the repository is focused on single-threaded python nodes.

** Nodes
- =delay_server=: Offers a =/delay (std_srvs/srv/Empty)= service that delays for 3 seconds before returning
- =deadlock=: This node calls =/delay= improperly and deadlocks
- =await=: This node uses python [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html][asyncio]] to wait for the service to complete
- =future=: This node directly polls a future object after calling the service
- =yield=: This node uses python generators to help sequence a pattern

* Usage
- It is often useful to run the server and the experiment node in separate windows, to see how they interact:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ros2 run async_experiments delay_server # run the delay server
  ros2 run async_experiments <deadlock|await|future|yield> # run the node of your choice
  #+END_SRC
- A launchfile can also be used: ~ros2 launch async_experiments experiment.launch.xml experiment:=<deadlock|await|future|yield>~
